# Activity: Reflecting on Coding Paradigms
* In this activity, we will get a chance to express what we've learned so far in regards to the paradigms of Functional and Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
* The activity will be completed in a few distinct stages.
* The first step will consist of implementing a solution to a problem for each coding style.
* Once a solution that adheres to the coding paradigm has been implemented, there are several questions to answer.
* These questions pertain to how and why the coding paradigm in question helps us solve the problem.
* When answering these questions, it may be helpful to envision an interview setting.
* The final part of the activity consists of a writing prompt to reflect on the past two modules, and your personal impressions of them.
## Getting Started
* Create a Replit named Reflecting on Coding Paradigms using the Python template.
* Do your work and write your answers for the following prompts in the generated main.py file.
* For the thought prompts, write your answers as comments.
* As you work through the prompts, be sure to add comments telling what section each solution is for.
## Functional Prompt
* Implement a function that will flatten and sort an array of integers in ascending order, and which adheres to a functional programming paradigm.
### Remember, when writing in a functional style:
* Keep variables immutable
* Write only pure functions
* Remember, functions may be higher order
### Once a functional solution to this problem has been implemented, answer the following questions.
* How does this solution ensure data immutability?
* Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?
* Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?
* Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?
* Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?
## Object Oriented Prompt
### Watto needs a new system for organizing his inventory of podracers.
* Help him do this by implementing an Object Oriented solution according to the following criteria.
*****
* First, he'll need a general Podracer class defined with max_speed, condition (perfect, trashed, repaired) and price attributes.
* Define a repair() method that will update the condition of the podracer to "repaired".
* Define a new class, AnakinsPod that inherits the Podracer class, but also contains a special method called boost that will multiply max_speed by 2.
* Define another class that inherits Podracer and call this one SebulbasPod.
* * This class should have a special method called flame_jet that will update the condition of another podracer to "trashed".
### Once an Object Oriented solution has been implemented, answer the following questions:
* How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP?
* (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)
* * Encapsulation
* * Abstraction
* * Inheritance
* * Polymorphism
* Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?
* How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?
### Reflection
* Take some time now to think about the lessons we've just covered.
* Prompting questions have been provided, but reflections do not need to be limited to only their answers.
*****
* Is one of these coding paradigms "better" than the other? Why or why not?
* Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigms, which seems more appealing? Why?
* Now being more familiar with these coding paradigms, what tasks/features/pieces of logic would be best handled using:
* * Functional Programming?
* * Object Oriented Programming?
* Personally, which of these styles takes more work to understand?
* What should be done in order to deepen understanding related to this paradigm?
